              <p>Part of the fungi kingdom, magic truffles are the underground part of the well-known magic mushrooms, and contain the same psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. the official name for magic truffles is sclerotium (plural: sclerotia).
              <p>In the soil where mushrooms grow, there is an entire network of mycelium, a white, stringy structure that grows outward  to find water and food so the mushroom, the fruiting body of the fungus, can grow. When the conditions (temperature, moisture, nutrients) are not right for mushrooms to grow, mycelium hardens into compact masses, or truffles, containing food and water reserves ready to be utilised by the fungus if and when growing conditions become optimal.</p>
              <p>There are about 200 different kind of mushrooms on earth known to contain psilocybin and psilocin. Only a handful of these species are able to produce magic truffles.</p>
              <p>In 2008, magic mushrooms were made illegal in the Netherlands (as they are in most other countries). However, since magic truffles differ from mushrooms, both technically and scientifically, they are 100% legal and widely produced, purchased, and consumed in the Netherlands, even though the psychoactive compound psilocybin is found in both fungi.</p>

              <p>After the spanish conquered central and south america, catholic missionaries forbade the use of hallucinogenic plants and mushrooms, dismissing the Aztecs as devil-worshippers. still, people in some remote areas continued to use teonanácatl.</p>
              <p>The first mention of magic mushrooms in european medicinal literature appeared in the london medical and physical journal in 1799: a man had served magic mushrooms he had picked for break</p>
              <p>In 1955, the mushroom researcher Gordon Wasson and his wife Valentina became the first westerners to ever participate in an indigenous mushroom ceremony when they encountered Maria Sabina, a mexican mushroom shaman, with whom they experienced several overnight mushroom rituals. Upon Wassons’ return to the United States in 1957, he published the photo essay “seeking the magic mushroom” for life magazine recounting his experiences with Sabina. The doctor who treated them later described how the youngest child “was attacked with fits of immoderate laughter, nor could the threats of his father or mother refrain him.”</p>
              <p>The story became a sensation and inspired early hippies to travel to Mexico in search of the magic mushrooms. The large scale production and use of magic mushrooms and other psychedelics during the hippy movement in the 60s and 70s, created a transformative cultural shift in the us and the rest of the world. In 1968, the United States banned psilocybin and in 1970, classified it as a schedule I drug (on par with heroin and cocaine). Psilocybin is still considered a schedule I drug, but with the emergence of new scientific studies, there are significant movements pushing for the legalization and/or decriminalization of psilocybin. The spiritual, mental, emotional benefits of magic mushrooms are slowly being brought to the light again.</p>

              <p>Magic truffles and magic mushrooms have the same exact effects. The journeyer’s mindset and the environment in which she will experience the truffles (also known as set and setting) play a large factor in the pleasantness of his journey.</p>
              <p>After consuming truffles you will start noticing the first effects after about 30 to 60 minutes. The duration of a truffle journey ranges between 4 and 6 hours, depending on several factors including preparation method, metabolism, body weight, previous experience with psychedelics, tolerance from a recent psilocybin experience, and amount and strength of truffles used. there is usually a “peak,” from hours 2-4 in which journeyers may experience more vivid visuals and distortions in reality.</p>
              <p>Everyone experiences truffles in his or her own different way, but the most reported effects are alterations in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Sensory perception — sounds, visions and physical sensations intensify. Colors are usually perceived as more intense, objects may appear wavy or pulsating, as well as bigger or smaller than they actually are. Sounds are often perceived in a clearer, more enveloping and intense way. Music can take on a profound sense of cadence and depth. Some users experience synesthesia, wherein they perceive, for example, a visualization of color upon hearing a particular sound. With higher doses, visual and auditory hallucinations can occur;</li>
                <li>Perception of time — minutes may seem like hours and hours may seem like minutes. In more extreme cases, time may seem to stop existing all together;</li>
                <li>Short-term memory — you may lose your train of thought in the middle of a sentence or get “lost” on your way to the bathroom;</li>
                <li>The idea of being an individual — you may feel more unity with other beings, animals, plants, and the universe. Truffle journeys can be mystical and religious experiences.</li>
                <li>Your emotional states — although there may be some initial anxiety, in many cases people will laugh a lot and become euphoric. People may also feel extreme sadness and many tears can be shed. usually, journeyers describe this as a positive “release.”</li>
                <li>Creativity — your thinking will often become more associative. This means you are more likely to make connections between things that usually go by unnoticed.</li>
                <li>Physical — some journeyers experience headache, nausea, uneasy stomach, pupil dilation, vomiting, muscle weakness, drowsiness, and lack of coordination. However, the quality of truffles play a large role in the occurrence of these physical side effects. The more care used in growing, storing, and preparing the truffles, the less the most negative of these effects seem to be present.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As a general rule, truffles will amplify the mood you are in. It is advisable to use truffles when you are feeling well, both physically and mentally. Taking truffles in a safe and quiet environment is important. A location in the countryside makes for a beautiful experience, and an indoor journey may also be preferable for those who want a more controlled experience on high doses. It is best not to have anything planned the day after your journey, so you have time to rest and integrate your experience.</p>
              <p>The human body builds up tolerance for the active substances in truffles very quickly. Therefore, it is not possible to have daily or continuous trips. Also, there are so-called cross-tolerances with other substances. Recent use of LSD for instance, may lessen the effect of truffles or prevent an effect from occurring altogether. We advise a minimum of 10 days between trips.</p>
              <p>With higher doses, mushrooms can be very intense in that they could cause near-death experiences, loss of self and communication with non-physical entities. One phenomenon that the mushroom is famous for in particular, is that it invokes the hearing of a voice in users. This voice has been described as old, male, low-pitched, slow-paced and low of volume. While the information that this voice transmits can vary, the experience is generally described as positive, insightful and healing. In some reports, the voice appears to have claimed that it is of extraterrestrial origin, the voice of earth or the mind of god.</p>
              <p>Continuing along these lines, it is then not surprising that many users report experiences with elves, fairies, spirits, extraterrestrials and even deities after ingesting mushrooms. Many subjects also report encounters with bygone ancestors, animal, and plant spirits.</p>

              <h2>Benefits</h2>
              <p>It is unsurprising that a johns hopkins university <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-006-0457-5" target="_blank">study</a> on the spiritual significance of psilocybin mushrooms has found that one third of the respondents had the most spiritually significant experience of their lives after ingestion. Almost 80% reported increased well-being in the months following the study. Fourteen months later, nearly all the experiment’s participants reported it was one of the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives. 39% Said it was the single most meaningful experience of their lives.</p>

              <h2>Usage</h2>
              <p>There are several different ways to take truffles. To maximise their effects, it is best to take them on an empty stomach. The most common method is to simply chew them well and swallow. For those who would prefer not taste the truffles, we can use a truffle grinder and mix the truffle powder with water or orange juice. Eating a few nuts or some dark chocolate can also help mask the taste.</p>

              <h2>Dosage</h2>
              <p>How many grams of truffles you will want to consume depends on:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Youur intentions</li>
                <li>Your body weight</li>
                <li>Your previous experience with psychedelics</li>
                <li>The concentration of active compounds in the magic truffle species</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Usually, a 15-gram dose will cause substantial effects. Some people are satisfied with less whereas certain experienced journeyers may decide to take 30-50 gram doses.</p>
              <p class="note">Important note: the above doses refer to fresh truffles. Dried mushrooms do not have the same dosages, because so much water evaporates during the dehydrating process, 5g of most dried mushrooms is considered an extremely heavy dose. If this is your first time, please use caution and read others’ experiences with magic mushrooms before consuming any yourself.</p>
